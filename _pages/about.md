I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at the Weizmann Institute of Science. I am fortunate to be advised by [Rotem Arnon](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/arnon/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of quantum information theory and theoretical computer science, with a primary focus on cryptography in the quantum setting.

### Research Interests

More specifically, I am focused on:

* **Quantum Cryptography:** Understanding security when quantum attackers have access to side-channel information. This includes building leakage-resilient compilers and protocols for quantum computation.
* **Quantum Information Theory:** Exploring the foundations of quantum mechanics through resource theories, generalizations of entropy (like Rényi and Petz), and the study of entanglement.
* **"Pseudo" Concepts:** I am particularly interested in computational analogues of information-theoretic concepts, such as pseudo-entanglement, pseudo-randomness, and their applications.
* **Quantum Complexity:** Investigating the limits of bounded quantum computation and its relationship to cryptography.
